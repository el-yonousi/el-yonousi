            Hello, I am Mohamed El YONOUSI, born on March 05, 1996, in Morocco, I have a
            passion for research and self-learning, providing service to society and
            humanity, I am not afraid of developments in the technology domain, and I
            always like to share what I have learned, whether by applying it in something
            or sharing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned algorithms and programming concepts starting from the year 2018, and
            the methodology for finding the right solutions to problems, followed by
            applying what I learned to the C programming language, and then followed with
            the concepts of object-oriented programming, by applying that the in C#
            programming language, then databases concepts, and so on...
